- Requirement:
    - Need to install Mininet

- final_skel.py
    - My topology code written in Python. It contains all the links, switches, and hosts needed to make a network. 
    It routes all the devices together so it can communicate with one another so as long as it doesn't violate any
    rules set via the instructions. 

- finalcontroller_skel.py
    - My controller code where it sets the rules the network has to follow. This is the file that allows hosts to
    communicate with one another and doesn't allow certain hosts to send traffic to others.
